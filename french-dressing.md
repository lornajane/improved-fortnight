# French Dressing

- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 4 tablespoons olive oil

Mix ingredients and stir until well blended. Some prefer the addition of a few drops onion juice. 
French Dressing is more easily prepared and largely used than any other dressing.

Best served cold.
