# Custard Pie

- 2 eggs
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1½ cups milk
- Few gratings of nutmeg

Beat eggs slightly, add sugar, salt, and milk. Line plate with paste, and build up a fluted rim. Strain in the mixture and sprinkle with few gratings nutmeg.

Bake in quick oven at first to set rim, decrease the heat afterwards, as egg and milk in combination need to be cooked at low temperature.

Serve with custard.
