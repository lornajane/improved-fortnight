# Tomatoes Stuffed with Pineapple

Peel medium-sized tomatoes. Remove thin slice from top of each, and take out seeds and some of pulp.
Sprinkle inside with salt, invert, and let stand one-half hour.
Fill tomatoes with fresh pineapple cut in small cubes or shredded, and nut meats, using two-thirds pineapple and one-third nut meats.
Mix with Mayonnaise Dressing, garnish with Mayonnaise, halves of nut meats, and slices cut from tops cut square. Serve on a bed of lettuce leaves.
